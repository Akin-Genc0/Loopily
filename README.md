# Basic Quiz Application

A simple quiz application built to refresh my DOM manipulation and event handling skills. This project features:

- **5 Quiz Questions**  
  Questions are stored in an array of objects along with their choices and correct answer indexes.

- **Navigation Controls**  
  Next and Back buttons allow users to move through the quiz questions.

- **Reset Functionality**  
  At the end of the quiz, a reset button lets users restart the quiz.

- **Score Tracking**  
  The application keeps track of correct and wrong answers and displays the final score when completed.

- **Modern UI**  
  A clean and modern user interface that dynamically updates based on user interactions.

## Tools Used

- **HTML:** 
- **CSS:** 
- **JavaScript:** 

## Features

- **Dynamic DOM Updates:**  
  The quiz questions and answer choices update dynamically as users navigate through the quiz.

- **Event Handling:**

- **State Management:**  
  Variables for tracking question index (`count`), score, and wrong answers.
